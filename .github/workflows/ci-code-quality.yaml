# 🛠️ Code Quality Workflow
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow ensures code quality by running pre-commit hooks on all branches.
# It automatically checks for code style, formatting, and other quality issues before changes are merged.
# The workflow is triggered on every push to any branch but skips execution on merged pull requests.
